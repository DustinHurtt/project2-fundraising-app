# project2-fundraising-app

The challenge here was to build a fully functionable app with Express and Handlebars.

I chose to build a funraising app that could be used to raise funds for Ukrainian Refugees.  A person can sign up and donate to various campaigns.  Or create a campaign of their own.  

Certain aspects of what I'd envisioned for this app proved quite challenging when restricted to Express and Handlebars, but I was able to find some novel solutions and it was a fantastic learning experience.

I managed to display a "countdown to deadline" that refreshes every time the screen is loaded, to show "total amount raised" and a "percentage to goal" that updates every time a donation is made, show recorded dates recorded from MongoDB in a human readable format, and utilize an API from Stripe to verify payments.
