# project2-fundraising-app

The challenge here was to build a fully functionable app with Express and Handlebars.

Certain aspects of what I'd envisioned for this app proved quite challenging when restricted to Express and Handlebars, but I managed to find some novel solutions and it was a fantastic learning experience.

I managed to display a "countdown to deadline" that refreshes every time the screen is loaded, to show "total amount raised" and a "percentage to goal" that updates every time a donation is made, and to show dates recorded for MongoDB in a human readable format.
